2017-09-18 09:07:40,278 Not sure about it man. There are other dirty songs too out there and this not even factoring the same shit peddled in our Indian movies. 

This cringe would have been dead but this article helped it in gaining more notoriety. The author should have predicted this hatred before penning an article/video and maybe should have gone anonymous, male or female, it doesn't matter. Ffs this is the internet era, a name and photo is more than enough to get harassed by these retards and edgelords for days to come. I remember this page "Designated Shitty Memes 2.0" harassing some girls in same fashion when few of them compained about their dark humour in the comment section. 

In no way I am trying to justify the threats and cheap catcalling where these Facebook pages are involved . Some of them have really sad sense of humour and upload equally dumb, cringe inducing memes and else act as nothing but repost machines.
